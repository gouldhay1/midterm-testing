                        <p>This one is a little more complicated but it becomes easy quickly.<br><br>

                        First, reach your right knee up until it looks like you are halfway through a march.<br><br>

                        Third, pull your ankle up towards the sky whilst keeping your knee in the same spot until your leg makes roughly a <strong>45 degree</strong> angle with the ground.<br><br>
                        
                        Finally, hold this for about <strong>2-3 seconds</strong> progressively pulling on your leg a little harder to <mark class="important">maximize the stretch in your hips.</mark> Take 3 steps, repeat with the opposite leg, and, as always, <strong>4 times per leg.</strong></p>

Reach your hands out straight behind you and <em>slowly</em>, while keeping your arms straight, reach your hands down and then out in front of you in one fluid motion. Do this as if you were attempting to <strong>scoop the air</strong> with your arms. You should feel this one in your <mark class="important">calves and the back of your thigh.</mark> Per usual, <strong>4 times per leg.</strong></p>

                        <p>This one is much simpler than the others but start by standing sideways. Then, place your left and right foot out to your sides until they are about half your body length away from each other. Finally, lean <em>deep</em> to the left and the right feeling your <mark class="important">inner thighs stretch.</mark> Take a few steps and repeat this stretch <strong>4 times.</strong></p>

                        <p>For the final stretch in the routine, you are going to start by reaching your arms out in front of you. Then, you are going to kick your leg out to about the height of your arms. Finally, when your leg is on the way back down cross your feet and <em>reach</em> down as you close as you can to your toes. This one is done a little more quickly so it might help to think of it as <mark class="important">kick, cross, and reach.</mark> Repeat this <strong>4 times per leg.</strong></p>

                For workout days implementing some high knees, butt kickers, striders, and any other mobility exercises that you can think of, can be very useful and a great start to a great workout.
