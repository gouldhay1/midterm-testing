                    <div class="text">
                        <p>To start off the stretching routine grab your knee, pull it close to your chest, and hold it for about 2-3 seconds. You should be able to feel the stretch in the back of your thigh. Then, walk 3 steps forward and do the same stretch but grabbing the opposite knee. Repeat this 4 times for each leg.</p>

                        <p>Reach your foot up towards your glutes and cup the top of your foot, pulling it towards your glutes further. Hold this for about 2-3 seconds and then drop your leg, take 3 steps forward, and repeat with the opposite leg. Repeat this stretch 4 times for each leg. You should feel this stretch in the front of your thigh.</p>

                        <p>This one is a little more complicated but it becomes easy quickly.<br><br>

                        First, reach your right knee up until it looks like you are halfway through a march.<br><br>
                        
                        Second, grab your ankle with your left hand and your knee with your right hand for support.<br><br>

                        Third, pull your ankle up towards the sky whilst keeping your knee in the same spot until your leg makes roughly a 45 degree angle with the ground.<br><br>
                        
                        Finally, hold this for about 2-3 seconds progressively pulling on your leg a little harder to maximize the stretch in your hips. Take 3 steps, repeat with the opposite leg, and, as always, 4 times per leg.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Next, reach one leg out in front of you, placing your heal on the ground and bending the knee of your opposite leg a little. Reach your hands out straight behind you and <em>slowly</em>, while keeping your arms straight, reach your hands down and then out in front of you in one fluid motion. Do this as if you were attempting to scoop the air with your arms. Per usual, 4 times per leg.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>This one is much simpler than the others but start by standing sideways. Then, place your left and right foot out to your sides until they are about half your body length away from each other. Finally, lean <em>deep</em> to the left and the right feeling your inner thighs stretch. Take a few steps and repeat this stretch 4 times.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>For the final stretch in the routine, you are going to start by reaching your arms out in front of you. Then, you are going to kick your leg out to about the height of your arms. Finally, when your leg is on the way back down cross your feet and <em>reach</em> down as you close as you can to your toes. This one is done a little more quickly so it might help to think of it as kick, cross, and reach. Repeat this 4 times per leg.</p>

                <p id="summary">The stretches in this routine are meant to stretch out and prepare the muscles you use when you run. By doing these stretches you can help prevent injury, speed up recovery, and feel better while you are running.<br><br>

                For workout days implementing some high knees, butt kickers, striders, and any other mobility exercises that you can think of, can be very useful and a great start to a great workout.
