                <p>After a long run it is important to replenish your body so that you can get back to feeling strong and healthy. Carbohydrates and proteins are among the most important nutrients needed for the body when it comes to long-distance running. These nutrients must be prioritized to get the most out of replenishing your body.<br><br>

                Carbohydrates are mainly used to fuel the body and they are the main source of energy when it comes to running. Some examples of foods with high amounts of carbohydrates are bread, potatoes, rice, oats, fruits, and vegetables.<br><br>
                    
                Proteins are not burned for energy but they are used for repairing and building muscles which is crucial for improvement. Some examples of foods with high amounts of protein are eggs, chicken, nuts, peanut butter, and beans.</p>

                <p>When you run, naturally, you get hot because your muscles are all working constantly causing your blood to flow more rapidly. This increased blood flow and temperature needs to be countered which is why you sweat. When you sweat you lose water along with electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium. It is important to replenish these because they aid in the transportation of nutrients to the muscles in the body.<br><br>

                By simply drinking more water and including electrolyte consumption in your diet you can significantly increase recovery and performance.</p>
