                <h2>Heart Health</h2>
                    <p><img src="images/heart_plus_24dp_1F1F1F_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg">There are many ways to improve heart health but long distance running is among the best ways. Long distance running works all kinds of different muscle tissues in the body. Some of these are the muscle tissues that line your veins and arteries so running keeps them strong and healthy.<br><br>

                    Another reason that it improves your heart health is because it increases your VO2 Max. Your VO2 Max is a measurement of the maximum amount of oxygen that your body can absorb and use during exercise. Increasing your VO2 Max increases how efficiently oxygen is pumped to the muscles, which is no doubt a result of increasing heart health.<br><br>
                    
                    Studies have also shown that running can decrease blood pressure.</p>

                        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Runners have been shown to be <em>30%</em> less likely to die from cardiovascular issues.</p>

                <h2>Sleep Quality</h2>
                    <p><img src="images/bedtime_24dp_1F1F1F_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg">Running outside during the day exposes your eyes to sunlight and this causes your body to release cortisol. Cortisol has all kinds of benefits but one of the best benefits is that it aids your circadian rhythm. This is your internal clock and it controls your sleeping and waking patterns and it helps determine when you should feel energized or tired during the day. In short, the sun releases cortisol and helps regulate your circadian rhythm resulting in better sleep.<br><br>

                    Cortisol also regulates the body's stress response, helping you deal with stress as it comes. This means that when you lay down for a good nights sleep you will have much less on your mind and having a clear mind before bed has been shown to result in a better nights sleep.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h3 class="sectionhead">Weight Loss</h3>
                            <p>Long distance running triggers an increase in metabolism and it burns plenty of glucose for energy. This is important for weight loss because your body turns excess glucose into fat. An increase in metabolism is really just increasing the rate at which your body burns calories when at rest so this greatly helps with weight loss as well.</p>

                            <section>
                                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Long distance running will cause you to have a higher muscle to fat ratio, giving off a much more lean look.</p>

                        <h3 class="sectionhead">Muscle Gain</h3>
                            <p>Although long distance running is not the best way to build muscle, it does build different muscles than it would if you were running short distances. These different muscles are the hips, glutes, and core muscles and they are very important for things like balance and preventing injury.<br><br>
                            
                            Distance runners have also been proven to be able to recover faster than people who do not run long distance</p>

                                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> You absorb <em>2-4 times</em> your body weight every step that you run and this is great for building muscle.</p>

                        <h3 class="sectionhead">Bone Density</h3>
                            <p>Long distance running increases bone density in a variety of ways.<br><br>

                            When you run for long distance the constant impact of your feet hitting the ground puts a great load on your bones. Although this sounds bad, it is actually very good. This is because this load stimulates bone-forming cells causing them to create more bone tissue and, with time, this increases the strength and density of your bones.<br><br>
                        
                            Studies have shown that a hormone called osteocalcin, a hormone produced by bones, is much higher in individuals who run long distances regularly than those who do not.<br><br>

                            Running long distances increases bone mineral density, especially in the bones in the legs and feet. Normally as you get older bone mineral density decreases, but studies have shown that older individuals that regularly run long distances maintain an increased bone mineral density.</p>

                                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Bones of long distance runners can be up to <em>5%</em> more dense than those of non-runners.</p>

                <h2>Mental Health</h2>
                    <p><img src="images/neurology_24dp_1F1F1F_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg">Long-distance running creates what many people know as a “runner's high”. Running long distances can cause this because it triggers a release of endocannabinoids into the body which is very similar to Cannabis. This provides decreased stress levels and a sense of calm.<br><br>

                    It can also boost your mood significantly as some studies have shown that running long distances can have the same effect as depression and anxiety medication.<br><br>
                    
                    Running long distances also floods the body with endorphins which are one of the body's natural painkillers and stress relievers.</p> 
                    
                    <section>
                        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Running doesn't just reduce your immediate stress, it improves your brain's ability to deal with future stress too.</p>

                <h2>Lung Capacity</h2>
                    <p><img src="images/vo2_max_24dp_1F1F1F_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg">Running long distances increases lung capacity and breathing efficiency.<br><br>

                    When running, you are constantly taking in large amounts of air to ensure that your muscles constantly have enough oxygen to continue working effectively. This constant inhaling and exhaling of air causes your diaphragm to work much harder than usual. The diaphragm tends to weaken with age, possibly leading to breathing issues and the weakening of the heart. So, running regularly can reverse this and prevent these issues entirely.<br><br>
                    
                    Running frequently forces your lungs to adapt to increased oxygen demand and this results in better airflow as well.</p>
                    
                    <section>
                        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Healthy muscles have been shown to need less oxygen to work effectively. So, having these healthy muscles can actually make your lungs do less work, rather than more.</p>
